# FreeBASIC Miner
FreeBASIC game by [niz567](https://freebasic.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4995). You can read a review of the game [here](http://games.freebasic.net/BASICGaming/Issue2/index.html#review1).

The original game works only on Windows. My purpose, by creating this repository, is to make the game compatible with Linux. The objective is partially achieved. The game runs on Linux, but without the sound effects...

Please note, the program in its current version must be compiled in 32-bits.
