# FreeBASIC Miner
FreeBASIC game by [niz567](https://freebasic.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4995). You can read a review of the game [here](http://games.freebasic.net/BASICGaming/Issue2/index.html#review1).

The original game works only on Windows. My purpose, by creating this repository, is to make the game compatible with Linux. The objective is partially achieved: the game runs on Linux, but without sound effects.

Another objective would be to make the game compilable to 64-bits. In its current version, the program must be compiled to 32-bits, otherwise it doesn't work.
